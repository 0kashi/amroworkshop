**Why use `oc` over `kubectl`**<br>
Being Kubernetes, one can definitely use `kubectl` with their OpenShift cluster.  `oc` is specific to OpenShift in that it includes the standard set of features from `kubectl` plus additional support for OpenShift functionality.  See [Usage of oc and kubectl commands](https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/4/cli_reference/openshift_cli/usage-oc-kubectl.html) for more details.
