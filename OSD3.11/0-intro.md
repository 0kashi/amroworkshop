### What will we do in this workshop?

In this lab, you’ll go through a set of tasks that will help you understand some of the concepts of deploying and securing container based applications on top of OpenShift Dedicated 3.11.

Some of the things you’ll be going through:

- Creating a project on the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console
- Deploying an application via the Source-to-Image (S2I) builder
- Explore DevOps pipeline to deploy the application as well
- Familiarization with OpenShift and Kubernetes functionality

You’ll be doing the majority of the labs using the OpenShift CLI, but you can also accomplish them using the OpenShift Dedicated web console.
